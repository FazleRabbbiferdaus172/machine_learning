Learning to hand code machine learing algotihms

## List of algorithms
<!--OL-->
1. Perceptron learning:
  <!--UL-->
  * A binary classifier
  * if the input is greater than or equal a threshold then the output is positive otherwise the output is negative.
  * compares the true class labels tothe predicted class labels.
  * weights are updated based on a unit step function 


2. Adaline algorithm:
  <!--UL-->
  * Improvemont of Perceptron learning algorithm.
  * weights are updated based on a linear activation function.
  * The cost function is Sum of Squared Errors
  * Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function
